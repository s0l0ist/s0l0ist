# 👋 Hey, I'm Nick Angelou 🦀

I scale systems, build secure infrastructure, and chase clean abstractions -
usually in Rust 🦀, but not always.

## 🔬 Projects & Research

### [🧬 ferroid](https://github.com/s0l0ist/ferroid)

A ULID or Snowflake-style ID generator in Rust. Fast, lock-free, and production-ready for
distributed systems.

- Designed for high-throughput ID generation with minimal contention
- Built for performance, testability, and extensibility in backend infra

### [📊 Vizdom](https://vizdom.dev)

Rust-native diagram-as-code platform for programmatic diagram generation and
embedding.

- Full-stack app using `leptos`, `axum`, and `tokio` with SSR and client
  hydration
- Runs entirely on AWS Lambda with streamed HTTP responses via CloudFront -
  faster than static S3 for warm requests
- Zero-dependency TypeScript SDK:
  [`@vizdom/vizdom-ts-node`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vizdom/vizdom-ts-node)

### [🔒 PSI / NeurIPS 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09350)

Co-authored a multi-language asymmetric Private Set Intersection (PSI) library
in C++, Rust, Go, Python, JS, and WASM.

- Used in NVIDIA's FLARE SDK
- Applied to privacy-preserving contact tracing and vertical federated ML
- Accepted at [NeurIPS 2020 (Privacy-Preserving ML
  Workshop)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09350)

### [🔐 node-seal](https://github.com/s0l0ist/node-seal)

TypeScript bindings for Microsoft SEAL's homomorphic encryption library.

- Compiled with Emscripten + Embind
- Fully documented with a live demo:
  [seal-sandbox](https://s0l0ist.github.io/seal-sandbox)
